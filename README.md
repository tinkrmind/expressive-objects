We used [Vuforia Studio](https://www.ptc.com/en/products/augmented-reality/vuforia-studio) to build the demos. The [tutorials](https://www.ptcu.com/enrollment/student/fundamentals-of-ar-development-with-vuforia-studio?utm_source=NewTrial-VFStudio&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=NewTrial-VFStudio-PortalPage-7-2018&utm_content=banner) are quite sufficient for recreating most of the demos. The [forum](http://bit.ly/2MLmLZ6) is fairly helpful, not the best though. Here are a few tips and tricks:

Use JS and a cloud server instead of the thingworx cloud. Itâ€™s just easier and less inhibiting.
Paint 3D is a great resource for CAD models and also for modifying models.
Vuforia studio is happy with .fbx files.
